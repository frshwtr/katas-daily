Daily kata practise

## 26/8/2021 8:50am

I've been away for a little bit :( Had a bit of the low mood along with my 2nd COVID vaccine taking all my energy away yesterday. But I'm back! So I'm going to refresh on FizzBuzz in bash again.
### Task

**Time:** 10 mins

#### FizzBuzz

From [AgileTechPraxis/katalog](https://github.com/AgileTechPraxis/katalog).

Write a function that takes numbers from 1 to 100 and outputs them as a string, but for multiples of three returns Fizz
instead of the number and for the multiples of five returns Buzz. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five
returns FizzBuzz.

### Wrap up

Iteresting to see how variable assignmed worked in bash for this activity. I definitely need to keep practising with bash before the fundamentals are second nature.
