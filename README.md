Daily kata practise

## 26/8/2021 8:50am

It was a bank holiday weekend and I've forgot how to code, oh no! That'll teach me to be less laissez faire with my long weekends.

Uncle Bob reckons music can have an adverse effect on your professional work mode; claiming that music can make it easier for you to get in to 'the zone' which can affect good professional practise. That's just the gist, I recommend reading chapter 4 of  Uncle Bob's 'The Clean Coder' for more insight.

To test this, I will listen to some music I like and complete a kata exercise. I will compare my results to the last commit and wrap up with some closing thoughts.

My choice of music is [Pendulum's Hold Your Colour](https://open.spotify.com/album/4FAfNNU21dqtKKhHWB2eOa?autoplay=true). 

This is entirely unscientific, but I'm curious to see if there's any huge differences. I may repeat this on future daily Katas.

### Task

**Time:** 10 mins

#### FizzBuzz

From [AgileTechPraxis/katalog](https://github.com/AgileTechPraxis/katalog).

Write a function that takes numbers from 1 to 100 and outputs them as a string, but for multiples of three returns Fizz
instead of the number and for the multiples of five returns Buzz. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five
returns FizzBuzz.

### Wrap up

I was definitely rushing to write code. Perhaps the faster BPM of Pendulum had some affect. I definitely felt like I spent less time thinking and went in to an automatic mode of writing code. This led to some mistakes where I relied on console feedback to tell me if I was making mistakes.
