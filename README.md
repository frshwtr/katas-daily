Daily kata practise

## 12/8/2021 Evening

This evening, I was joined by [joostm020](https://github.com/joostm020) for a little pair programming exercise. We will go through the laws of TDD and solve the FizzBuzz problem, test-driven style!

### Task

**Time:** As long as we need

#### FizzBuzz

From [AgileTechPraxis/katalog](https://github.com/AgileTechPraxis/katalog).

Write a function that takes numbers from 1 to 100 and outputs them as a string, but for multiples of three returns Fizz
instead of the number and for the multiples of five returns Buzz. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five
returns FizzBuzz.

### Wrap up

joostm020 really impressed me. They are pretty new to TDD but picked up the principles very quickly. I hope we get to pair again soon and learn more!
