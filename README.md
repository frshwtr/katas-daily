Today I'm going to do something a bit different: FizzBuzz, but in Bash.

I'm not the best with Bash, I intent to try this over the course of a few days and see how much I can improve my Bash knowledge.

### Task

**Time:** 10 mins

#### FizzBuzz

From [AgileTechPraxis/katalog](https://github.com/AgileTechPraxis/katalog).

Write a function that takes numbers from 1 to 100 and outputs them as a string, but for multiples of three returns Fizz
instead of the number and for the multiples of five returns Buzz. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five
returns FizzBuzz.

### Wrap up

Lots to learn on Bash. Though today was good to understand conditionals a bit more. I didn't manage to get FizzBuzz to work but hey there's always next time.

It would be nice to find some kind of testing framework for bash too.
