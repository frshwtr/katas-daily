Daily kata practise 

## 9/8/2021

For today's Kata, I will do the same exercise as yesterday, but on my work machine instead.

### Task
**Time:** 10 mins

#### FizzBuzz
From [AgileTechPraxis/katalog](https://github.com/AgileTechPraxis/katalog).

Write a function that takes numbers from 1 to 100 and outputs them as a string, but for multiples of three returns Fizz instead of the number and for the multiples of five returns Buzz. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five returns FizzBuzz.

### Wrap up

A little smoother today! I made sure that I kept the tests passing for the right reasons throughout. I stumbled on some situations where my function would return `undefined`. But was able to solve quickly based on feedback.

My work machine definitely feels less sluggish compared to my linux machine at home. I'm thinking the free Nvidia drivers might not be well optimised for WebStorm. I tried the nonfree ones but that completely broke my system! Will investigate more tongiht :)
