Today I will try to work on the things that I mentioned at the end of the last session.

### Task

**Time:** 10 mins

#### Nth Fibonacci

From [AgileTechPraxis/katalog](https://github.com/AgileTechPraxis/katalog).

Write a function that generates the Fibonacci number for the Nth position implementing the method with signature:


`int Fibonacci(int position)`


>  First Fibonacci numbers in sequence:
>
>  Position | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9
>  --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
>  **Fibonacci** | **1** | **1** | **2** | **3** | **5** | **8** | **13** | **21** | **34**
>


### Wrap up

I couldn't think of another solution to keep the result of fibonacci sequence 1 or 2 at one. Using the `if` is the simplest method I could think of, but I am still wondering if there's a way to ensure it returns one for these with a mathematical formula instead of a conditional expression.

### Things for next time
I'm thinking about C for next time ðŸ‘€
