## 5/10/2021 8:50am

Let's do something different today.. new kata day!

### Task

**Time:** 10 mins

#### Nth Fibonacci

From [AgileTechPraxis/katalog](https://github.com/AgileTechPraxis/katalog).

Write a function that generates the Fibonacci number for the Nth position implementing the method with signature:


`int Fibonacci(int position)`


>  First Fibonacci numbers in sequence:
>
>  Position | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9
>  --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
>  **Fibonacci** | **1** | **1** | **2** | **3** | **5** | **8** | **13** | **21** | **34**
>


### Wrap up

Some small set-up issues, looks like I forgot to commit some config files.

I got a little bit stuck trying to get numbers smaller than two working :( A good first start to this kata. Hopefully I get a little further next time.

### Things for next time
I'm thinking about C for next time ðŸ‘€
