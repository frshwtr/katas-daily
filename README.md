Let's see if I can get a fully working FizzBuzz solution this time. I won't use test-driven principles just yet. Once I know how to crack the solution with the basics of bash, I'll have a look around for some bash testing strategies and try it.

### Task

**Time:** 10 mins

#### FizzBuzz

From [AgileTechPraxis/katalog](https://github.com/AgileTechPraxis/katalog).

Write a function that takes numbers from 1 to 100 and outputs them as a string, but for multiples of three returns Fizz
instead of the number and for the multiples of five returns Buzz. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five
returns FizzBuzz.

### Wrap up

I got the multiple of three and five check working nicely this afternoon. I also managed to get bash functions in play. Pretty productive evening :)

### Tomorrow

My friend challenged me to try and write FizzBuzz with the least characters possible in js. Their record is 59!
