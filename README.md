Daily kata practise

## 16/8/2021 Evening

I think I went a bit hard on the weekend... definitely felt the dehydration this morning. I've recovered a little, I've had my coffee, so let's give FizzBuzz a go!

### Task

**Time:** 10 mins

#### FizzBuzz

From [AgileTechPraxis/katalog](https://github.com/AgileTechPraxis/katalog).

Write a function that takes numbers from 1 to 100 and outputs them as a string, but for multiples of three returns Fizz
instead of the number and for the multiples of five returns Buzz. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five
returns FizzBuzz.

### Wrap up

Today I forced distractions by sitting in a call with my coworkers whilst we had a casual chat. My mind was definitely less focused on coding but I was able to make less mistakes than last time. Definitely think stress plays on my performance!
