Daily kata practise

## 13/8/2021

It's (nearly) the weekend! I'm going to see out the working week by doing one last kata on my work machine. The idea for today is to get used to the different shortcuts between my Mac and Linux machine.

### Task

**Time:** As long as we need

#### FizzBuzz

From [AgileTechPraxis/katalog](https://github.com/AgileTechPraxis/katalog).

Write a function that takes numbers from 1 to 100 and outputs them as a string, but for multiples of three returns Fizz
instead of the number and for the multiples of five returns Buzz. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five
returns FizzBuzz.

### Wrap up

I got very distracted by some things occuring at work today. But I'm not taking that as a bad thing! I observed how I performed with distractions compared to the previous katas where I was more focused. It's interesting to see how I used less Webstorm shortcuts when distracted. I guess it shows how minimising distractions helps keep you focused!
