Daily kata practise

## 30/9/2021 8:50am

Hello GitHub! It's been a while.

I took a small hiatus from this to focus practising on sewing instead.. a very different kind of practise, but it was still worthwhile to get in the habit of practising.

Today I'll try FizzBuzz in TypeScript and see where I get to.

### Task

**Time:** 10 mins

#### FizzBuzz

From [AgileTechPraxis/katalog](https://github.com/AgileTechPraxis/katalog).

Write a function that takes numbers from 1 to 100 and outputs them as a string, but for multiples of three returns Fizz
instead of the number and for the multiples of five returns Buzz. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five
returns FizzBuzz.

### Wrap up

Not as rusty as I thought I would be! I did skip test driving the degrees of freedom for Fizz and instead went straight to test driving Buzz. But other than that, following TDD was a breeze.

I managed to find time to do some additional improvements such as using Enums, which I didn't find the time for before.

I think it's time to try another Kata, or a different language. I'm thinking about C for next time ðŸ‘€
