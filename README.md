Daily kata practise

## 11/8/2021 Evening

So I finally got down to the bottom of my driver issue on Linux, turns out updating just the graphics drivers is a
no-no. After a lot of googling it turns out I needed to update everything on my system and now it works!

Now I will test-drive Webstorm to see if it performs better with the non-free drivers.

### Task

**Time:** 10 mins

#### FizzBuzz

From [AgileTechPraxis/katalog](https://github.com/AgileTechPraxis/katalog).

Write a function that takes numbers from 1 to 100 and outputs them as a string, but for multiples of three returns Fizz
instead of the number and for the multiples of five returns Buzz. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five
returns FizzBuzz.

### Wrap up

Today I learned:

* Non-free drivers work much better with Webstorm.
* `Ctrl+Alt+F10` is not the right command to run tests in Webstorm.
* `Ctrl+Shift+Bksp` will close all applications and log you out...

Other than the small hickups with commands, I am pleased to see Webstorm performing well with these new drivers. There is less lag making it a much more enjoyable coding experience.

I still need to brush up on my keyboard shortcuts on linux. Perhaps I should standardise the shortcuts across Linux/MacOS?

I think next time I will spice FizzBuzz up and write it in bash or something..
